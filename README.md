# Agent Starter for React

This is a starter template for [LiveKit Agents](https://docs.livekit.io/agents) that provides a simple voice interface using the [LiveKit JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/livekit/client-sdk-js). It supports [voice](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/start/voice-ai), [transcriptions](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/build/text/), and [virtual avatars](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/integrations/avatar).

Also available for:

## Getting started

> [!TIP]
> If you'd like to try this application without modification, you can deploy an instance in just a few clicks with [LiveKit Cloud Sandbox](https://cloud.livekit.io/projects/p_/sandbox/templates/agent-starter-react).

[![Open on LiveKit](https://img.shields.io/badge/Open%20on%20LiveKit%20Cloud-002CF2?style=for-the-badge&logo=external-link)](https://cloud.livekit.io/projects/p_/sandbox/templates/agent-starter-react)

Run the following command to automatically clone this template.

```bash
lk app create --template agent-starter-react
```

Then run the app with:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

And open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

You'll also need an agent to speak with. Try our starter agent for [Python](https://github.com/livekit-examples/agent-starter-python), [Node.js](https://github.com/livekit-examples/agent-starter-node), or [create your own from scratch](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/start/voice-ai/).

## Local Development Setup

This project contains both a Python agent (the backend) and a Next.js web application (the frontend). Follow these steps to set them up for local development.

### Prerequisites

- [Python](https://www.python.org/) 3.9+
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) (which includes `npm`)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) (you can install it with `npm install -g pnpm`)

### 1. Backend Setup (Python Agent)

The backend is the Python agent that connects to LiveKit and handles the AI logic.

**a. Create a Virtual Environment**

It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage Python dependencies.

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
# On Windows, use: .venv\Scripts\activate
```

**b. Install Dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**c. Configure Environment Variables**

Create a file named `.env` in the root of the project and add the following variables.

```env
# LiveKit credentials (get these from your LiveKit project)
LIVEKIT_API_KEY="YOUR_LIVEKIT_API_KEY"
LIVEKIT_API_SECRET="YOUR_LIVEKIT_API_SECRET"

# Optional: For the email tool
GMAIL_USER="your_email@gmail.com"
GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD="your_gmail_app_password" # Use a Gmail App Password

# URL for the MCP server (if you are using one)
# This can be left blank if you are not using the MCP client.
N8N_MCP_SERVER_URL=""
```

**d. Run the Backend**

You can now run the agent. It will wait for a connection from the frontend.

```bash
python agent.py start
```

### 2. Frontend Setup (Next.js App)

The frontend is the web interface you will interact with in your browser.

**a. Install Dependencies**

In a **new terminal window**, navigate to the project root and run:

```bash
pnpm install
```

**b. Configure Environment Variables**

Create a file named `.env.local` in the root of the project and add your LiveKit credentials. The frontend needs these to connect to the LiveKit API.

```env
LIVEKIT_API_KEY="YOUR_LIVEKIT_API_KEY"
LIVEKIT_API_SECRET="YOUR_LIVEKIT_API_SECRET"
LIVEKIT_URL="https://your-livekit-server-url" # e.g., wss://my-project.livekit.cloud
```

**c. Run the Frontend**

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Now, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser. You should see the application interface. When you start a session, it will connect to your backend agent through your LiveKit instance.

## Configuration

This starter is designed to be flexible so you can adapt it to your specific agent use case. You can easily configure it to work with different types of inputs and outputs:

#### Example: App configuration (`app-config.ts`)

```ts
export const APP_CONFIG_DEFAULTS = {
  companyName: 'LiveKit',
  pageTitle: 'LiveKit Voice Agent',
  pageDescription: 'A voice agent built with LiveKit',
  supportsChatInput: true,
  supportsVideoInput: true,
  supportsScreenShare: true,
  logo: '/lk-logo.svg',
  accent: '#002cf2',
  logoDark: '/lk-logo-dark.svg',
  accentDark: '#1fd5f9',
  startButtonText: 'Start call',
};
```

You can update these values in [`app-config.ts`](./app-config.ts) to customize branding, features, and UI text for your deployment.

#### Environment Variables

You'll also need to configure your LiveKit credentials in `.env.local` (copy `.env.example` if you don't have one):

```env
LIVEKIT_API_KEY=your_livekit_api_key
LIVEKIT_API_SECRET=your_livekit_api_secret
LIVEKIT_URL=https://your-livekit-server-url
```

These are required for the voice agent functionality to work with your LiveKit project.
